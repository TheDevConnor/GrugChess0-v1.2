A python Chess Engine!
This is my secound attemped at a chess engine. The first one that I made was not the best and had a lot of bugs.
So if you guys find any bugs please report them to me so i can try and fix them!

For the AI i will be looking into tenserflow and a neral network.

For the chess game you have the basic functions like checks, en-passant, and castling. Here are some exampls of them!
